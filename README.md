# A7Xpg

Old school chase action game 'A7Xpg'.

## How to play

Control your ship and gather golds. The ship accelerates while holding the boost button. A boost power runs out about 1.5 seconds, so you have to push the boost button again to maintain the speed.

The gauge at the right-down corner is the power gauge. The power increases when you take a gold at high speed. When the power gauge becomes full, your ship becomes invincible for a while. Attack enemies and earn the bonus score.
